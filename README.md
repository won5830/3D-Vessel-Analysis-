# A computational tool for 3D analysis of vascular networks 

This repository contains the source code for 3D quantitative analysis of vascular networks. This MATLAB implementation can be simply compiled through installer package. 

### Installation
There is 2 options for implementation. By running `3D_Vessel_Analysis.exe` in the `..\installer\for_redistribution` folder, you can install the application. As another choice, run `ExampleApp.mlapp` to skip a lenghty installation. Make sure the search path include the proper pulled directory.


### Implementation Detail

First, choose the folder that contains the 2D slice images of the vascular network. Each image should be binarized for loading. You can apply pertinent pre-processing for those images. ㅈㄹ
